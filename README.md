Any businessman or supermarket employee who want to visualize the sales of different products over a certain period. As a businessman we need to be continuously wary about the sales figure and the ares in which the store can improve on. Following would be the idea users of this project.

# Insights

1.Credit card is the least prefered mode of payment prefered by the customers in all the branches A,B and C.One thing to note is that even in this digital age, most of the customer in Brach C tend to make cash payments.The shopkeerers should ensure that these basic activies go as digital as possible.

2. Food and beverages and fashion accessories have a lower average quantity then the rest of the products. This may be because the store may be giving discounts on the wholesale purchase of these products

3.the store manager shoud give discounts even on the retail purchase of these product cateogries as there is already a huge demand for these products among customers and espically among men.

4.Yagon is the only city where the peak hour is only in the evening. This indicates that customers in Yagon only prefer late night shopping as they might be busy throughout the day. Thus the shopkeepers must make sure that they have sufficient staff in the night duty to avoid understaffing which may further affect sales.

5.It is very evident that the gross income of the story is rising at a diminishing rate so clearly something's going wrong.

6.The females tend to shop more in the morning and afternoon whereas men prefers to shop at mainly during the evening time.

Though we may have garnered some insights from the visualizations, it must be noted that customer can be very fickle minded and even these insights may not be able to give any suitable results. Since this is not within our control, the best we could do is analyze the customer behavious and align our decision accordingly.
